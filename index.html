      <!-- CompTIA A+ -->
      <h1>CompTIA A+ Overview</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="text-area-box">
        <h3>What is the CompTIA A+?</h3>
        <p>The A+ certification is an entry level IT certification. It tests your knowledge of basic IT
          infrastructure
          knowledge, identifying and troubleshooting physical computer components and operating systems. The exam
          is
          split in two, with the first half mostly focused on physical repair, printers, and identifying parts.
          The
          second half is more focused on networking, operating system troubleshooting, and basic command line
          operation.</p>
        <h3>What can I do with the CompTIA A+ and why should I get it?</h3>
        <p>The A+ by itself does not fully qualify you for any specific position, rather it is used to show that
          you
          know at least the basics about multiple different topics. The A+ Exam is considered equivalent to 9
          months
          experience (per CompTIA), however it will usually only allow you to get hired for entry level positions
          such
          as help desk, computer repair, and customer support. The A+ is best utilized not as a standalone
          certification but with others such as the CompTIA Trifecta. The A+ exam is many peoples first step into
          the
          world of IT.</p>
        <h3>What is the CompTIA Trifecta?</h3>
        <p>The CompTIA Trifecta consists of the A+ exam, Network+ exam and Security+ exam. By gaining these three
          you
          show prospective or current companies that not only are you committed to your career and learning, but
          you
          are also qualified for more advanced IT Careers. While these exams do not focus on any specific company
          or
          vendor, they do offer the knowledge that is utilized throughout and can easily be added to for any
          specific
          company’s needs.
          <br>
          <br>
          The trifecta is often suggested to anyone entering IT for the first time. Each exam builds upon the
          knowledge of the previous exams and helps you gain more confidence in your skills as an IT professional.

      <!-- CompTIA Network+ -->
      <h1>CompTIA Network+ Overview</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="text-area-box">
        <h3>What is the Network+?</h3>
        <p>The Network + Certification is an entry level (however more advanced and builds upon knowledge from the
          A+)
          exam designed to test your skills with setting up, managing, and troubleshooting networks. It tests your
          ability
          to identify routers/switches and know how to use both to segment network traffic, as well as VLANs
          (Virtual
          Local Area Network). It calls upon your knowledge of existing network hardware / technology as well as
          older
          legacy tech as well. The exam itself will test not only your knowledge of these topics, but also your
          ability
          to
          decide which of them is best in a given scenario.</p>
        <h3>What can I do with the Network+ and why should I get it?</h3>
        <p>Like the A+, Network + does not go into any specific vendor or company, it teaches and tests your
          knowledge
          of
          the fundamentals of how networks operate, and how to troubleshoot them. Having this certification does
          lead
          to
          the possibility of entry level IT Jobs better than A+ and is a great foundation for future vendor
          specific
          network certs such as Cisco’s CCNA. Knowing the fundamentals of networking is necessary for most IT
          jobs,
          and
          knowledge that anyone who works in the computer repair industry should have. Plenty of people know how
          to
          plug
          in their modem, and router and go, however knowing the how and why they work shows employers that you
          are
          dedicated to being the best technician you can be.</p>
        <h3>What is the CompTIA Trifecta?</h3>
        <p>The CompTIA trifecta consists of the A+ exam, Network+ exam and Security+ exam. By gaining these 3 you
          show
          prospective or current companies that not only are you committed to your career and learning but, you
          are
          also
          qualified for more advanced IT careers. While these exams do not focus on any specific company or
          vendor,
          they
          do offer the knowledge that is utilized throughout and can easily be added to for any specific company's
          needs.

      <!-- Security+ -->
      <h1>CompTIA Security+ Overview</h1>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="text-area-box">
        <h3>What is the Security+?</h3>
        <p>While technically an entry level exam for cybersecurity it is considered more difficult than the previous
          exams listed. The certification requires you to be able to identify and contain any security event or
          attack. This includes physical security, different encryption types and more. The Security+ Certification is
          more advanced and relies not only on your previous knowledge from Network+ and A+ but new additional
          information as well. The new exam (as of July 2021) has a greater emphasis on cloud technology security and
          vulnerability. It combines the traditional exam as well as hands on practical experience in order to make
          you as ready as possible to take on a job utilizing cybersecurity.</p>
        <h3>What can I do with the Security+ and why should I get it?</h3>
        <p>The Security+ is well regarded in the industry as the best “entry level” security certification you can
          attain. Like other CompTIA exams it does not focus on any vendor rather the fundamentals and helps establish
          a baseline that employers look to while hiring. Security + is not only approved by the U.S. Department of
          Defense but is often required before hiring. Cybersecurity is one of the most in demand fields in IT
          currently. With cloud-based technology becoming more and more adopted, and ransomware attacks on the rise
          the need for people in cybersecurity will only grow. Most security professionals will tell you it is not a
          matter of “if” you get attacked but “when”. This amounts to job security and a challenging work environment
          with room for growth. </p>
        <h3>What is the CompTIA Trifecta?</h3>
        <p>The CompTIA trifecta consists of the A+ exam, Network+ exam and Security+ exam. By gaining these 3 you show
          prospective or current companies that not only are you committed to your career and learning but, you are
          also qualified for more advanced IT careers. While these exams do not focus on any specific company or
          vendor, they do offer the knowledge that is utilized throughout and can easily be added to for any specific
          company's needs.

          knowledge of the previous exams and helps you gain more confidence in your skills as an IT professional.</p>
